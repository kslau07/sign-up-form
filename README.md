## My Goals 

Since the purpose of this project is to apply what we've learned about forms, in this project I will try to utilize:

- Field targeting depending on input by user
- Design that follows WCAG 
	* aria-labels for required fields
- Design with better/easier UX in mind
- Use of `:placeholder-shown` to create an automatic help message for fields
- Various input validation techniques
	* Use of JS, `pattern` for regexp, and html attributes (`minlength`, etc.)

We've learned a lot of CSS lately and I will use this project to practice some of those techniques. The list includes (but is not limited to):

- Use of CSS custom properties and functions:
	* `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()`, `calc()`
- Use of a CSS reset sheet
- Use of more CSS units:
	* `em`, `ex`, `rem`, `ch`, `px`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`
- Use of different color functions:
	* `rgba()` and `hsla()`
- Use of advanced CSS selectors:
	* `:first-child`, `:first-of-type`, `:nth-of-type`, etc.
	* other pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Use of functions for responsive typography
- Letter spacing (on logo, text content)
- Load custom font (woff, woff2)
- Use of the Emmet plug-in to speed up coding
- A custom SVG image
- Animating widgets (the button, etc.)
